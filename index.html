      <h3>THE STORY BEHIND IT ALL</h3>
      <p>My fascination with Germany began early. As a child, I devoured documentaries and books about the country’s history and culture. When it came time to choose a language in school, I eagerly told my
          counselor I wanted to learn German. But my parents encouraged me to pick Spanish instead, thinking it would be more practical. After struggling through two years of Spanish, they finally allowed me
          to switch to German, and that’s when my interest truly ignited. I was captivated not just by the country but by the language itself.</p>
          
        <p>In high school, I dreamed of living in Germany and immersing myself in its culture. I even had an opportunity to join a school trip to Germany, but just before we were set to go, my parents withdrew me
          from the trip, concerned about safety. I was devastated but determined to make it there one day. A few years later, that dream became a reality when I was assigned to serve as a missionary in Berlin,
          Germany. With only basic high school German and a brief language training, I found myself learning directly from the people, building connections through daily conversations and teaching myself with a
          grammar book. Over 19 months, my skills grew, but after returning to the U.S., I found few opportunities to use my German, and my hard-won fluency started to fade.</p>
          
        <p>To keep my connection to the language, I chose to minor in German at college (which has since become part of my major), but I struggled, partly due to undiagnosed ADHD. This experience taught me that
          language learning can be especially challenging for those with cognitive differences—yet, with the right strategies, it’s entirely possible. I wanted to create a resource that could help others like
          me, who don’t want to lose their language skills and who need a more flexible, tailored approach to learning.</p>
          
        <p>So I began researching the tools that best support long-term language retention and engagement, especially for people with diverse learning needs. The result is German Mastery—a platform designed to
          make learning German accessible and sustainable for everyone.</p>
          
        <p>What started with a child’s curiosity has grown into a lifelong passion and a mission to help others on their journey.</p>
